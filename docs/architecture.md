The Dayflow system follows a client-server architecture.

Frontend:
The frontend provides dashboards for Employees and HR/Admin. Users interact through web pages to view profiles, apply for leave, and check attendance.

Backend:
The backend handles authentication, business logic, attendance records, leave approvals, and payroll management.

Database:
Stores user accounts, attendance logs, leave requests, and salary information securely.

Role-Based Access:
Employees can only view their own data, while HR/Admin can manage all employees.
