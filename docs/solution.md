Dayflow is a web-based HRMS that enables employees to manage their profiles, attendance, and leave, while HR/Admin users can approve requests, monitor attendance, and manage payroll.

The system uses role-based authentication to ensure that employees can only view their own data while HR/Admin have full management access. It reduces paperwork, prevents data errors, and improves efficiency.
