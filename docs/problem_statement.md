Dayflow – Human Resource Management System aims to solve the problem of inefficient and insecure HR operations. Traditional systems make it difficult to track employee attendance, manage leave, and handle payroll accurately.

The lack of centralized and role-based platforms leads to data inconsistency, delayed approvals, and reduced transparency. This system provides a digital platform where employees and HR can interact through a secure and structured workflow.
